# Copilot Instructions for ktcheck

## Project Overview

ktcheck is a property-based testing library for Kotlin, inspired by QuickCheck/Hypothesis. It generates random test inputs and intelligently shrinks failing cases to minimal counterexamples.

### Architecture

**Core Components:**
- `Gen<T>`: Generator monad that produces values and shrink trees
- `ProducerTree`: Lazy binary tree structure driving value generation (left=data, right=continuation)
- `TestConfig`: Test execution configuration (iterations, seed, reporter)
- Generators in `gen/`: Int, Boolean, List, Set, OneOf, etc.

**Key Design Patterns:**

- **Left-Right Traversal**: Collections use left subtree for elements, right for continuation (see ListGenerator.kt)
- **Shrinking via Tree Replacement**: Shrinks are ProducerTrees that replace subtrees, not direct values
- **Lazy Shrink Evaluation**: Shrinks are `Sequence<ProducerTree>` for memory efficiency
- **GenMode**: Distinguishes `Initial` generation from `Shrinking` (affects distinct collection handling)

### Generator Patterns

**Creating Generators:**
```kotlin
// Combine independent generators
val gen = Gen.int() + Gen.bool()  // Returns Gen<Tuple2<Int, Boolean>>

// Dependent generation (second depends on first)
val gen = Gen.int(1..10).flatMap { size -> Gen.int().list(size) }

// Map/transform
val gen = Gen.int().map { it * 2 }
```

**Shrinking Behavior:**
- Ints shrink toward 0 (or nearest range bound) by halving distance
- Booleans shrink true→false
- Lists shrink by size reduction (tail/head removal) then element-wise
- Sets handle duplicates during shrinking by accepting smaller sizes when in range

## Running Tests

### Command Pattern
```bash
./gradlew :test --tests "<fully.qualified.ClassName.testMethodName>" --console=plain
```

**CRITICAL**: Always use `--console=plain` flag when running tests to see full output!

### Viewing Test Output (REQUIRED WORKFLOW)

**ALWAYS use this workflow when running tests:**

1. Delete any existing output file before each test run
2. Write test output to `output.txt` using `> output.txt 2>&1`
3. Read the output file to check results

```bash
# Template for EVERY test run
rm -f output.txt && ./gradlew :test --tests "<TestClass>" --console=plain > output.txt 2>&1

# Then read the file ONCE to check results
```

**How to interpret the results:**

- **If the file contains "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"** → All tests passed ✅
- **If the file contains "FAILED"** → Tests failed ❌ (read the failure details)
- **If the file contains "FAILURE: Build failed with an exception."** → Compilation failed ❌ (check for compilation
  errors in the output)
- **If none of these phrases are found** → Something is wrong and needs troubleshooting ⚠️
- **No need to grep or search multiple times** - just read the file once

**Important: Avoid Redundant Test Runs**

- **If you've run tests for a whole file**, don't run subsets of tests from that file - you've already run them all
- **If you've run the entire test suite**, don't run individual test files - you've already run everything
- **If tests are succeeding (BUILD SUCCESSFUL)**, the code is compiling correctly - no need to check for compilation
  errors separately
- **Only run tests once per change** - trust the results and move forward

**Why this is necessary**: Terminal output from Gradle may not be visible in the IDE's tool output. Writing to a file
ensures you can always access the results.

### Examples
```bash
# Run all tests - write output to file
rm -f output.txt && ./gradlew test --console=plain > output.txt 2>&1

# Specific test class - write output to file
rm -f output.txt && ./gradlew :test --tests "com.tamj0rd2.ktcheck.gen.SetGeneratorTest" --console=plain > output.txt 2>&1

# Specific test method (quote if spaces) - write output to file
rm -f output.txt && ./gradlew :test --tests "com.tamj0rd2.ktcheck.gen.SetGeneratorTest.shrinks a set of 3 elements" --console=plain > output.txt 2>&1

# Pattern matching - write output to file
rm -f output.txt && ./gradlew :test --tests "*SetGenerator*" --console=plain > output.txt 2>&1
```

After running any test command, **ALWAYS** read `output.txt` to check the results.

### Critical Testing Notes
- Test names must be fully qualified: `package.ClassName.methodName`
- Nested test classes use `$`: `ClassName$NestedClass`
- **Always read terminal output** - HTML reports are not accessible to agents
- Full exception format is enabled via `TestExceptionFormat.FULL`
- Test failures show: test name, assertion error, expected vs actual, stack trace

### Common Test Locations
- Generator tests: `com.tamj0rd2.ktcheck.gen.*GeneratorTest`
- Test framework: `com.tamj0rd2.ktcheck.testing.*Test`
- Shrinking challenges: `com.tamj0rd2.ktcheck.gen.ShrinkingChallenges`

## Testing Conventions

**Formatting for Readable Tests:**

- Always add a blank line between arrangement, action, and assertion sections in all new or modified tests.

**Test Utilities:**
- `Gen.samples()`: Infinite sequence of generated values for distribution testing
- `Counter.withCounter {}`: Collect and verify percentage distributions
- `Gen.generateWithShrunkValues()`: Test helper exposing shrink tree (see GenTests.kt)
- `producerTree {}`: DSL for constructing predetermined test trees

**Property Test Patterns:**
```kotlin
// Boolean property
forAll(Gen.int()) { value -> value + 1 > value }

// Exception-based property  
checkAll(Gen.int()) { value -> expectThat(value).isGreaterThan(-1) }

// With configuration
forAll(TestConfig().withIterations(1000), Gen.int()) { /* test */ }
```

## Development Workflow

**Building:** `./gradlew build`
**Testing:** `./gradlew test` (JUnit 5, Strikt assertions, Java 21 toolchain)
**Publishing:** Jitpack (version 0.0.2)

**Environment:**
- `ktcheck.test.iterations` system property controls default iteration count (default: 1000)
- Seed can be hardcoded for reproducible debugging via `TestConfig.replay(seed, iteration)`

### TDD Approach

**Critical: When implementing new features or fixing bugs involving tests:**

1. **Verify test setup first** - Run the test to ensure it fails at the expected assertion, not due to setup issues
2. **Work line-by-line** - Validate each assertion fails/passes as expected before proceeding
3. **Fix test setup before production code** - If tests fail on unexpected lines, fix the test setup (e.g., tree
   construction with `producerTree {}`)
4. **Get feedback before changing production code** - Propose implementation approach and wait for confirmation
5. **Never assume test setup is correct** - Question whether the test is exercising the code path you think it is

**Example workflow:**

- Run test → fails at line 10 (expected value)
- Fix: adjust tree setup with `producerTree { left(expectedValue) }`
- Re-run → fails at line 15 (expected shrinks)
- Now ready to implement production code changes

### Plan Execution Rules

**CRITICAL: Code must compile at the start AND end of each step in a plan.**

When executing a plan with multiple steps:

1. **Before starting a step**: Verify the code compiles
2. **After completing a step**: Verify the code compiles
3. **If a step would break compilation**: Add stub methods/data structures to maintain compilation

**How to maintain compilation during incremental changes:**

- **Add stub methods**: When adding interface methods, implement them immediately with
  `throw NotImplementedError("TODO: implement in step X")` or `TODO("Not yet implemented")`
- **Add stub data structures**: Create empty/minimal classes/interfaces even if they'll be filled in later steps
- **Add stub imports**: Import types that will be needed, even if not fully implemented yet
- **Never leave code in a non-compiling state** between steps

**Example - Adding a new interface method:**

```kotlin
// Step 1: Add to interface
interface MyContract {
    fun newMethod(): String  // Added in this step
}

// Step 1: MUST also add stub implementations to all implementing classes
class MyImpl : MyContract {
    override fun newMethod(): String = TODO("Implement in step 3")
}
```

**Example - Adding a new dependency:**

```kotlin
// Step 2: If we reference a new type that doesn't exist yet
// We MUST create it as a stub in the same step:

// Create the stub interface/class
internal interface INewType {
    // Minimal definition, will be filled in step 4
}

// Then we can reference it
fun useNewType(param: INewType) {
    TODO("Implement in step 4")
}
```

**Why this matters:**

- Each step should be a working checkpoint
- Easier to identify which change broke compilation
- Can verify tests at each step (even if they fail with NotImplementedError)
- Maintains a working codebase throughout the implementation process
